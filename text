The previous invoice print layout modifications have been reverted. Both `src/components/invoice/InvoiceDocument.tsx` and `src/pages/InvoiceDetail.tsx` have been restored to their original state from the beginning of this sub-thread.

**Analysis:**
The primary issue was the incorrect reversion of previous changes, leading to syntax errors. By explicitly reverting to the known good state from the initial context, these issues should be resolved. This action ensures that the invoice print functionality is back to its previous working condition, allowing us to restart the process if needed or focus on other tasks.

**Suggestions for the coding agent:**
1. Verify invoice print functionality.
2. Address legal template internationalization.
3. Improve CSS print styles.
